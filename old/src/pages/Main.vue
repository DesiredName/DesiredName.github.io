            Hello! My name is Anton.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a web-developer and a team-lead, I often come across some silly, thrilling and frustrating code, usage
            patterns, features and bugs.
            <br>
            <br>
            I stumble upon strange, badly organized, poorly architectured spaghetti-code.
            <br>
            <br>
            I believe that every developer sooner or later starts to think about what is written and how. How written is
            used and composed. And, finally, delivered to our beloved users.
            <br>
            <br>
            Information is priceless. But what is of a greater value?
            <br>
            <br>
            Experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes we need someone to share experience with us.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, please be welcomed.
